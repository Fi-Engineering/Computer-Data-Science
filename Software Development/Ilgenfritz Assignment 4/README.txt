The SpellChecker package is composed of 4 classes:
	Dictionary.java - has a filename that represents the name of the Dictionary file. Has a ilstOfWords variable that is an ArrayList of the words in that dictionary. The constructor accepts this filename and trys to construct listOfWords with every line in that file.
	WordRecommender.java - has a "filename" variable and a "dict" variable that represent the name of the dictionary file and the Dictionary class constructed with it respectively. Has four methods: getSimilarityMetric, getWordSuggestions, getWordsWithCommonLetters, prettyPrint. The first gets the similarity between two words, the second gets word suggestions based on incorrect word using that metric, the third gets the words in a list that share a number of common letters with a comparison word, and the fourth takes an ArrayList and prints its contents in an aesthetically pleasing way.
	SimilarityMetricWord.java - a custom class used to represent a word and its similarity metric as computed by the first method in the previously defined class. Has a double called similarity and a String called text. It implements the Comparable interface and defines that based on the similarity double.
	RunSpellChecker.java - the class that actually uses the other classes to spell check a file. It has three methods: getChoice, check, and main. The first acquires user input, comparing it against an ArrayList of expected values. If there aren't any, it just accepts whatever the user inputs. If there are expected values, it keeps prompting the user until it receives one of them. The second does the work of looping through the file intended to be checked and prompting the user for action regarding incorrectly spelled words. The third prompts tahe user for the file to check, creates a new file with the results of the user's choices, and displays where that file is written to.
